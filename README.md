# Nvim Config

## Introduction

This is my personal neovim configuration. That I will be using for all of my development work across my machines. I have tried to keep the configuration as well documented as possible to allow for easy understanding and modification.

## Installation Script

I have written a simple installation script that will install neovim and all the required plugins. The script is written in bash and can be found in the root directory of this repository. To run the script, simply execute the following command:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

This will install neovim and all the required plugins. It will also create a symlink to the `init.vim` file in the `~/.config/nvim` directory.
